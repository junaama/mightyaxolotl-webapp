          The idea behind Mighty Axolotl comes from our project leader's passion
          for aquatic life.

          <br />

          Apart from being extremely cute, the axolotl has unique biological
          qualities. Axolotls have an extraordinary tissue regeneration ability
          and share structures with humans, such as feet and digits—which means
          they are the perfect candidate for regenerative modeling research.
          Unfortunately, axolotls are a critically endangered species which
          means their population is quickly decreasing. For the profit of the Mighty Axolotl NFT collection we want to help fund research and safeguard axolotls.
