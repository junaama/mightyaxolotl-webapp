          The idea behind Mighty Axolotl comes from our project leader's passion
          for aquatic life.
          <br />
          <br />

          Apart from being extremely cute, the axolotl has unique biological
          qualities. In fact, axolotls have an extraordinary tissue regeneration ability
          and share structures with humans, such as feet and digits, which means
          they are the perfect candidates for regenerative modeling research.
          Unfortunately, axolotls are a critically endangered species, which
          meansÂ their population is quickly decreasing. We will donate 10% of project earnings to axolotls and amphibian environmental safeguard.
